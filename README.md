# Textbook-Finder

## Concept
## This project consist of a Web Application design to be hosted on a server and makes use of an existing API to pull descriptive data about textbooks. It includes an ERD diagram, class diagram, several wire-frame sketches that illustrate the basic concept and useability of the application. In the simplest form, the application will retrieve a list of textbooks to be displayed to the user with descriptive information and direct link to the publisher/retailer.

<a name="userstory"></a>
## User-Stories <h2>
[table of content](#tcontent)
  
1)	As a college student, I want to be able to search for books by Name or ISBN number so that I can get a list of relevant results and links with option to click and visit the publisher’s/retailer’s website.
2)	As a professor, I need to be able to enter the name or ISBN number of a textbook into a search mechanism so that I can see a list of books to choose from to aid in future assignments.
3)	As an everyday user, I need to be able to search for any kind of book or publication with links to other resources such as ReadMyBook (Richard Lee’s project) for the visually impaired and/or store locator (using google maps).

## Use Cases <h2>
  
### Use Case – Actor: College Student – Search for assigned textbook
-	Given I have a textbook to search for and I have the name and/or ISBN number, when I attempt to search for the name or number of the textbook, a list of results should be displayed with descriptive information, external links for purchasing options and a map to locate nearby retailers.

### Use Case – Actor: College professor – Search for reference material 
-	As a professor, given I have a list of required textbooks passed down by the department chair, when I attempt to search for reference material through the use category filters, a list of relevant textbooks is displayed with descriptive information based on the category selected. (this should be a list of results of free material to use as reference) 

### Use Case – Actor:  Everyday user (staff) – Searching for a book to share
-	Given I have a book in mind to search for, and I search for the title by a specific name or ISBN number, I get a list of results that I can scroll through so that I can select a title and share it with social media such as Facebook, Tweeter or Instagram. 

### Use Case – Actor:  Everyday user (non-student) – Search for a book to read
-	Given I have a book in mind that I want to find for purchase, and I attempt to search for the book by name or ISBN number, a list of relevant results is displayed in which I can make a selection to display the location of a retailer, or use links to other applications such as: application that read text outloud.
